    <h2>General info:</h2>

    <p>This is a program used to help you create a character for Dungeons & Dragons, 5th edition. The program will roll stats for you in the basic way, rolling four six-sided dice, dropping the lowest number, then adding the remaining numbers together. Once you have rolled all your stats, you may assign them to any stat how you see fit.</p>

    <br>

    <h2>Planned updates:</h2>
